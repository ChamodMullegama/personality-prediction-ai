# IntroExtro - Introvert vs Extrovert Personality Prediction Web App

A machine learning web application that predicts whether a person is more of an introvert or extrovert, built using the dataset from the Kaggle competition “Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts (Playground Series S5E7)”. The model is trained with features from the competition’s dataset, and the web app allows users to input their own feature values to see the predicted personality type. Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training/inference, and a user-friendly front-end.
